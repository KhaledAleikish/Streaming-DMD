# Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD) which is
suited to performing DMD analysis on-the-fly. The implementation is based on the works of [Hemani, M. et al. -  *Dynamic mode decomposition for large and streaming datasets*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4901016), and [Zhang, H. et al. - *Online dynamic mode decomposition for time-varying systems*](https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1192329)

# Installation
