# Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (sDMD) as described in the paper [Liew, J. et al. -  *Streaming dynamic mode decomposition for short-term forecasting in wind farms*](). The algorithm is suited to performing DMD analysis on-the-fly. 

The implementation draws from concepts from similar works by [Hemani, M. et al. -  *Dynamic mode decomposition for large and streaming datasets*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4901016), and [Zhang, H. et al. - *Online dynamic mode decomposition for time-varying systems*](https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1192329)
